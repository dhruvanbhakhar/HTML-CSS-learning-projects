        <table><tr><td>
        Known for its natural beauty, fascinating history, ancient sites, unique islands, towns of whitewashed buildings, and fine weather, Greece ranks among the world s premier league travel destinations in Europe.

            Located in south-eastern Europe, Greece is nestled between the Mediterranean, Ionian, and Aegean seas, bordered by Albania, Macedonia (FYROM), and Bulgaria in the north and Turkey in the east.

            
        
            The sun-kissed Mediterranean country is made up of fabulous mountains and 6,000 idyllic islands and islets dotting the blue Aegean and Ionian Seas and has impressive sights with 18 UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

Fresh seafood, sizzling Mediterranean passion, sparkling nightspots, and mythical legend make Greece a fascinating and enchanting destination.

Wander the cobbled Byzantine footpaths, hike the volcanoes, cycle the lush forests, kitesurf, wreck dive, rock climb, and watch the dolphins and sea turtles. Or simply hop on a boat and sail into the gleaming blue sea.</td> <td>

From its vibrant cities to the gorgeous Italian lakes and coast, the landscapes will get you first. And then there’s the food and culture. There is truly something to enchant everyone.

The country’s famous tourist attractions are popular for good reason but it’s also been my mission to uncover the best kept secrets in Italy – local restaurants, quiet regions and bustling smaller cities.

Italy off the beaten track is very special and I want to help you discover it. Below are all the links to the best information on this site to help with inspiration and planning for your most memorable vacation to Italy.

<tr>
    <td>Rome was the third most-visited city in the world in 2017, with 20 million visitors. A popular tourist destination, the city is a vibrant mélange of historical ruins and modern architecture. With Eat, Pray, Love having added to the general quaint charm of Rome, walking the cobbled streets and soaking in la dolce vita (the sweet life) is one of the best experiences to have in the city.

        Rome has an immensely rich cultural heritage, which makes it one of Europe’s most stunning cities to visit. Its contemporary fashion offerings and modern nightlife, coupled with its historic legacy make it attractive for travellers of all ages and interest groups. If you’re a nature lover, Rome’s beautiful gardens and the nature are a treat for the eyes. Loved Gladiator? You can act the part by enrolling in Gladiator school. Love the food? Rome’s multitude of Italian cooking classes offer a chance to interact with the locals and make some lasting memories. Are you a movie buff? Recreate Roman Holiday on a vespa at night. And if you’ve got the stomach for it, visit the Roman catacombs and see 4,000 bones of Capuchin monks.
        
        Indeed, Rome has an experience for every traveller, making it a truly global city</td>
